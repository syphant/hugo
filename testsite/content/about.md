title = "What is this?"

I was inspired to create this as a place to post cool useful stuff that others might find interesting, mostly related to:

* 🪟 Windows
* 🐧 Linux
* 🐋 Docker
* 🚀 Self-hosted FOSS webapps
* 🍿 Media management
* ✨ Fun terminal shenanigans
* 💽 Hardware problems (hopefully not)
* 🌐 Learning more web development (I still suck at it)

So we'll see how frequently I end up adding content here, depending on available free time.
