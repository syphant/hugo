I don't know yet. Maybe I'll start posting cool and useful stuff here that others would find interesting, likely related to:

* Docker
* Linux
* Self-hosted FOSS webapps
* Media management
* Learning more web dev stuff that I suck at
* Hardware shenanigans
* Unholy technomancy forbidden by the Geneva Convention

I guess we'll see whenever inspiration and motivation strike me again.
