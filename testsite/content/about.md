I had the idea of creating this to post cool useful stuff that others would find interesting, mostly related to:

* 🐋 Docker
* 📦 Linux
* 🚀 Self-hosted FOSS webapps
* 🍿 Media management
* ✨ Fun terminal shenanigans
* 💸 Hardware problems (hopefully not)
* 🌐 Learning more web dev stuff that I suck at
* 🚫 Unholy technomancy forbidden by the Geneva Convention

As far as frequency is concerned, I suppose we'll see how often inspiration and motivation will strike.
